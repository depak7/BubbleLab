**Tool Transparency:** I used the `generate-chart-tool` to create a visual breakdown of execution counts, making it easier to spot the high-volume flows. I also used the `add-reaction-tool` to acknowledge your request with a `:bar_chart:` emoji.

**Fun Fact:** The word "robot" was first used in a 1920 play called _R.U.R._ (Rossum's Universal Robots) by Karel Čapek. It comes from the Czech word _robota_, which translates to "forced labor" or "drudgery."
