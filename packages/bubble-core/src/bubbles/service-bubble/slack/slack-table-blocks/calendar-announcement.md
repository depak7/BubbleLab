### 📅 Flow #150 — "Read My Calendar" is ready!

**What it does:**

1. Fetches your next 7 days of events from Google Calendar
2. Formats them with title, time, location, Meet links, and attendee count
3. DMs the summary to you on Slack

**Your calendars available:**

|     | Calendar                            |
| --- | ----------------------------------- |
| 💼  | `zachzhong@bubblelab.ai` (work)     |
| 👤  | `zachzhong.zz@gmail.com` (personal) |
| 🇺🇸  | US Holidays                         |

By default it reads your **primary** calendar, but you can point it at any of the above.

---

**A couple of things to sort out before activating:**

1. **Which calendar(s)** should it read? Work, personal, or all three?
2. **How should it trigger?**
   - 🔁 Daily schedule (e.g. 8am PT every morning)?
   - 💬 On-demand via Slack message?
   - Or keep it as a manual webhook for now?

Once you tell me, I'll finalize and activate it!
